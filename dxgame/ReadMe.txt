    CONSOLE APPLICATION : dxgame Project Overview
========================================================================

This was originally generated by the VS AppWizard.

Some files:

dxgame.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

dxgame.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

dxgame.cpp
    This is the main application source file. It actually contains _tmain() and the code
    to create a window, unless it's been refactored.

d3dclass.cpp
    This file contains code to intialize D3D and retains the ID3D11Device and ID3D11DeviceContext pointers.
    It's a modified version of the rastertek.com tutorial file.
    
objloader.cpp
    This is a .obj loader that I ported from grilliards; it was originally from an OpenGL tutorial.

simplemesh.cpp
    Another port from grilliards. I modified to use xnamath and render itself with D3D. DirectX rendering code
    is again modified from the rastertek tutorials. The xnamath knowledge is from Frank Luna's book.
    
textureclas.cpp
    Modified rastertek.com file to load a texture and retain the ID3D11ShaderResourceView pointer.
    Currently modified to use MS's WICTextureLoader.cpp. If load times become relevant, the DDS loader 
    should be easy to adapt.
    
textureshaderclass.cpp
    Heavily modified rastertek.com file to hold on to compiled shaders and the constant buffers that feed them.
    TODO: rename
    
vboindexer.cpp
    Another grilliards source file ported from glm to xnamath. Not sure if useful.
    
vertex.h
    The Vertex struct. I see no reason not to have it in its own header; it's used all over the place.

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named dxgame.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
